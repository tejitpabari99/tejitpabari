excerpt: "Researched on 'Flood Event Extraction from News Media to Support Satellite-Based Flood Index Insurance in Bangladesh'. Created and published a dataset of 40,000 tagged news articles covering flood events in Bangladesh by 10 prominent news sources. Developed a BERT-based classifier to extract flood-events. Created a flood-event time-series and defined criteria for flood occurrence and severity. Validated results against Sentinel data, with a correlation coefficient of 0.7. The results contributed to the development of a flood index insurance by the Bangladesh government. Authored a pre-print research paper and presented findings at the AGU conference."
